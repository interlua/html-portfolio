<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Lua, also known as AURACLE, is a multi-disciplinary artist born and raised in Northern Virginia.
  She is best known as a fashion designer, working with major companies during her 5 years living in NYC
  such as VFILES, Bandulu, and Head of State. Now living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Lua sets to build
  her own brand under the name of SYEK, which merges her love for clothing and music.
</p>

<p>While her passions involve clothing and music, she enjoys venturing outside of both worlds for experience
  and inspiration. She has partaken in film, dance, and currently coding. She's no stranger to being a 
  beginner and loves learning without shortcuts.
